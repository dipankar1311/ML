# Reinforcement Learning (RL)
## Overview
RL is a type of ML where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions, and its goal is to maximize its cumulative reward over time.

## Key components of RL:
Agent: the entity that learns and makes decisions
Environment: the world agent intracts with
State: current state of the agent within the environment
Action: decisions the agent can make
Reward: numerical value indicating the outcome of an action

## RL process / step:
Initialization: The agent starts in an initial state
Action: The agent chooses an action based on its current state and policy
Transition: The environment transitions to a new state based on the agent's action
Reward: The agent receives a reward based on its action and the new state
Update: The agent updates its policy to improve its future decisions
