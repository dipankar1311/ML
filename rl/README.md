# Reinforcement Learning (RL)
## RL is a type of ML where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions, and its goal is to maximize its cumulative reward over time.

# Key components of RL:
## Agent: the entity that learns and makes decisions
## Environment: the world agent intracts with
## State: current state of the agent within the environment
## Action: decisions the agent can make
## Reward: numerical value indicating the outcome of an action

# RL process / step:
